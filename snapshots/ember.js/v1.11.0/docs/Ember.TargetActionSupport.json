  "description": "<p><code>Ember.TargetActionSupport</code> is a mixin that can be included in a class\nto add a <code>triggerAction</code> method with semantics similar to the Handlebars\n<code>{{action}}</code> helper. In normal Ember usage, the <code>{{action}}</code> helper is\nusually the best choice. This mixin is most often useful when you are\ndoing more complex event handling in View objects.</p>\n<p>See also <code>Ember.ViewTargetActionSupport</code>, which has\nview-aware defaults for target and actionContext.</p>\n",
